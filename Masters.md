# Masters

_During my Master Building Technology I focussed largely on Structural Design and Computational Design. On this page I will go over some projects and on what I learned in these projects._

## Earthy

For this project I documented everything at another MarkDown website, click here to visit this (LINK) site. 

In Earthy students will dive into generating geometry for masonry buildings in refugee camps. In each aspect of the design of the project the computational power of GrassHopper is used. In the early stages of the project this meant finding optimal locations for the project, filtering out locations on basis of a preset preferences. My team and I developed a design for a Hammam in the camp, so we analysed other Hammam and using bubble diagrams tried finding an optimal layout. After taking on the challenge on using hexagonal grids, we could map the optimal layout to the grid and therefore had our location and program requirements.

To translate this to a buildable Hammam, several steps were taken ...



## Robotic ...

In the spring of 2019 I followed ... and ..., two courses focussing on robotic manufacturing of geometry.
