# Masters

_During my Master Building Technology I focussed largely on Structural Design and Computational Design. On this page I will go over some projects and on what I learned in these projects._

## Earthy

For this project I documented everything at another MarkDown website, click here to visit this (LINK) site. 

In Earthy students will dive into generating geometry for masonry buildings in refugee camps. In each aspect of the design of the project the computational power of GrassHopper is used. In the early stages of the project this meant finding optimal locations for the project, filtering out locations on basis of a preset preferences. My team and I developed a design for a Hammam in the camp, so we analysed other Hammam and using bubble diagrams tried finding an optimal layout. After taking on the challenge on using hexagonal grids, we could map the optimal layout to the grid and therefore had our location and program requirements.

To translate this to a buildable Hammam, several steps were taken ...


## Robotic Manufacturing

In the spring of 2019 I followed ... and ..., two courses focussing on robotic manufacturing of geometry. In these courses we explored the possibilities of using robots in architecture. In ... I focussed on making a pavillion out of wood, generating the shape and generating toolpaths for the robot. The shape can be seen in the picture below, which was based on light, rainwater and forces. We were able to test out our toolpaths in the Hogeschool van Amsterdam and learned a lot about how robots work and wood as a material for this.

During the same time I followed the course of Design Informatics, where the focus was again on robotic manufacturing. In this course in stead of removing material, additive manufacturing was used. In combination with the University of Prague, we developed a technique where hemp rope is infused with bone glue and then placed on panels. Using a robot arm the shape was generated and could then be dried. After a week of insense work, we managed to create a dome. In this project I was responsible with another student for any movement the robot made, from toolpaths to managing it on runtime. More information on this project can be found here.

## 3D Computer graphics

Following my personal interests in game design I followed a course at the faculty of EWI, with the subject of 3D Computer Graphics. The course consisted of in depth explanations of how 3D graphics are generated and how shaders are written. Together with some other students we created a small game from scratch, using C++ and the OpenGL library. In this game the player rides his car over hills and tries to hit enemies. We wrote everything ourselves, from shaders, terrain generation to game logic. In this project I learned how 3D graphics are generated and how to work in informatics projects, using programs like Git. In my free time I took this knowledge and further kept developing small games for fun.

## Other Courses

During my masters I followed other courses on structural design, building physics and architectural design. In Extreme I designed a new library for the country of Sint Maarten, taking in account extreme weather conditions. In Bucky Lab we created an alternative way of heating a hospital using old CPU coolers. This turned out to be not very effective, but the advantage was that rooms could be heated locally, resulting in a lower heat demand.
