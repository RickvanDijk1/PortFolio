#Architectural lessons from Topology Optimization

This page shows my work for my graduation, where I researched the topic of Topology Optimization and its possible implementations in architecture. This research was performed under the supervision of P. Nourian (_Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment_) and M. Langelaar (_Faculty of 3Me_). A link to my work in the TU Delft repository can be found [here](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:5dc60528-701c-496c-90a2-a804d7a7aada).
