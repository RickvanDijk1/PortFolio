## Welcome to my portfolio

Hello! My name is ir. Rick van Dijk, alumni of the faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment of the TU Delft. I graduated in 2020 with a Cum Laude degree, with research in generative design in architecture, using Topology Optimization. Since then, I am an AEC Developer / Engineer at an engineering firm. This website will show some of my projects, both in the university and in my working career.

## Me
_I am a young, enthusiastic developer, with great interest in the digital transformation in the Built Environment. Being educated as an engineer, and with a deep passion for development, I want to contribute to this progress. I have experience with languages such as C# and Python and I am eager to develop my skills further. I am enthusiastic, efficient, and interested in new techniques, especially across disciplines._

After graduating high school I started studying Architecture in Delft, which was something I knew for many years I wanted to study. I have always had an interest in the structural courses in my bachelor's and together with my profound enthusiasm for computers, the master's program of my choice was Building Technology. In my master's program I found my true passion; the combination of Structural Design, maths, and the strengths of computational design. The courses were innovative, fun, and challenging, which was the reason for my high grades, but above all, interesting results. In November 2019, I started graduation under the supervision of P. Nourian (Arch) and M. Langelaar (3Me) in Topology Optimization. I dived deep into the ins and outs of FEM, Optimization algorithms and implemented architectural relevant constraints, such as self-weight, and roofing constraints.

Here I work mainly as a Developer, developing software for designers in our firm. More can be read [**here**](https://rickvandijk1.github.io/PortFolio/Career).

In my spare time I am interested in game development, cooking, and trying to maintain a healthy and insect-friendly garden! Each December I try to finish the AdventOfCode (if you never heard of it, check it out), and for fun, I like to get a grip on innovative solutions and libraries, such as TensorFlow. I also really like to spend my free time in GoDot, making game logic for small game jams (on itch.io), or figuring out random things, like how a maze is generated or how sudokus are solved. Outside of that, I like to spend time with my wife, I like to think I am a great cook, we like to walk and meet friends! I also am quite musical, playing keys and drums in two small bands.
