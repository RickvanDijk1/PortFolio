## Welcome to my portfolio

Hello! My name is ir. Rick van Dijk, alumni of the faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment of the TU Delft. I graduated in 2020 with a Cum Laude degree, with a research to the implication of Topology Optimization in architecture. Since then I'm working at a engineering firm where I do modelling work as well as some workflow optimizations. This website will show some of my projects, both in the university and in my working career.
