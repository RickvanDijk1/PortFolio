## Welcome to my portfolio

Hello! My name is ir. Rick van Dijk, alumni of the faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment of the TU Delft. I graduated in 2020 with a Cum Laude degree, with a research to generative design in architecture, using Topology Optimization. Since then I'm an AEC Developer / Engineer at an engineering firm. This website will show some of my projects, both in the university and in my working career.

## Me
_I am a young, enthusiastic developer, with great interest in the digital transformation in the Built Environment. Being educated as an engineer, and with a deep passion for development, I want to contribute to this progress. I have experience with languages such as C# and Python and am eager to develop my skills further. I am enthusiastic, efficient, and interested in new techniques, especially across disciplines._

_After graduating for high-school I started studying Architecture in Delft, which was something I knew for many years I wanted to study. I've always been very keen of buildings in general and quickly I found out this was indeed the field I wanted to keep working in. I have always had an interest in the structural courses in my bachelors and together with my profound enthusiasm for computers, the master's program of my choice was Building Technology. In my master's programme I found my true passion; the combination of Structural Design, maths and the strengths of computational design. The courses were innovative, fun and challenging, which was the reason for my high grades, but above all, interesting results. In november 2019 I started graduation under supervision of P. Nourian (Arch) and M. Langelaar (3Me) into Topology Optimization. I dived deep into the ins-and-outs of FEM, Optimization algorithms and implemented architectural relevant constraints, such as self-weight and a roofing constraint.

Here I work mainly as a Developer, developing software for designers in our firm. More can be read [here](https://rickvandijk1.github.io/PortFolio/Career)._

_In my free time I'm having interests in game development, cooking and trying to maintain a healthy and insectfriendly garden! Each december I try to finish the adventofcode (if you never heared of it, check it out) and for fun I like to get a grip of innovative solutions and libraries, such as TensorFlow. I also really like to spend my free time in GoDot, making game logic for small game jams (on itch.io) or figuring out random things, like how a maze is generated or how sudokus are solved. Outside of that I really like to spend time with my wife, I like to think I'm a great cook, we like to walk and meet friends! I also am quite musical, playing keys and drums in two small bands._
