## Welcome to my portfolio

Hello! My name is ir. Rick van Dijk, alumni of the faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment of the TU Delft. I graduated in 2020 with a Cum Laude degree, with a research to the implication of Topology Optimization in architecture. Since then I'm working at a engineering firm where I do modelling work as well as some workflow optimizations. This website will show some of my projects, both in the university and in my working career.

### Me

_After graduating for high-school I started studying Architecture in Delft, which was something I knew for many years I wanted to study. I've always been very keen of buildings in general and quickly I found out this was indeed the field I wanted to keep working in. I have always had an interest in the structural courses in my bachelors and together with my profound enthusiasm for computers, the master's program of my choice was Building Technology. As a teen I really liked to develop mods for popular games, gave programming multiplayer a shot with a friend and was really interested in mining (alternative) coins (if only we kept going with that). In my master's programme I found my true passion; the combination of Structural Design, maths and the strengths of computational design. The courses were innovative, fun and challenging, which was the reason for my high grades, but above all, interesting results. In november 2019 I started graduation under supervision of P. Nourian (Arch) and M. Langelaar (3Me) into Topology Optimization. I dived deep into the ins-and-outs of FEM, Optimization algorithms and implemented architectural relevant constraints, such as self-weight and a roofing constraint. I graduated with a 9 in July and was therefore granted a Cum Laude degree. In september I started working at Pieters Bouwtechniek, an reknown engineering firm in Delft, where I started as a modeller. I quickly learned myself Revit and Dynamo and tried optimizing some workflows where colleagues worked very inefficiently._

_In my free time I like to consider myself somewhat of a nerd, having interests in game development, programming and some tactical games. Each december I try to finish the adventofcode (if you never heared of it, check it out) and for fun I like to get a grip of innovative solutions and libraries, such as TensorFlow. I also really like to spend my free time in UE4, making game logic for small game jams (on itch.io) or figuring out AI. Outside of that I really like to spend time with my girlfriend, I like to think I'm a great cook, we like to walk and meet friends!_
