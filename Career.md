## Pieters Bouwtechniek
_sep 2020 - now_

In September 2020 I joined Pieters Bouwtechniek as Engineer, with the intention to explore the company and find what suited me. I worked mostly at large housing projects. In these and many other projects, I learned the ins and outs of BIM desinging and I learned a lot about structural engineering. Reinforcing concrete in entire projects, researching old archives, and structurally checking the architect's choices in the early stages of the design, were my daily activities. I always continued to be involved in projects, growing into a coordinating role.

From the very beginning I used Dynamo to optimize my own workflows. I feel that Dynamo has great potential because it combines computational power with the most used BIM software. During my first projects, I started to map out actions that I would repeatedly do and replace them with small Dynamo scripts. These were very simple scripts that would allow me to rotate multiple objects, automatically make hollow-core slabs, tag all the elements in a sheet, or automatically fix foundation poles.

After half a year I joined the Developer team, which is a very small team of 2 colleagues in Amsterdam, to assist them in the software they write under the name of PBToolbox. Mostly we write add-ins (in C#) for our designers to use in Revit projects. Here I developed a deep knowledge in the RevitAPI, WinForms and how to collaborate in a team (in Azure DevOps). As the team was very small, I reviewed and improved a lot of older code. Examples of software I wrote are:

- *Modelchecker*; In projects, a lot of time is spent in verifying the data in a BIM-model. Therefore I wrote a program that verifies the data in a model, and displays elements that are not conform BIM- or Pieters-protocol. This included a UI that displays errors and warnings and lets users easily focus on elements.
- *Automatic reinforcements*; I wrote several functions that automaticly make reinforcements in all selected beams. 
- *3DBAG*; I wrote a implementation of the 3D BAG database by the TU Delft, so that our designers can import data from around their project.
- *Dimension tools*; I wrote several functions that place dimensions, which can be combined with the creation of views or drawings.
- *Exporting data*; In some projects assemblies are used to create part lists; With our tools we made it easy to export Revit Data to Excel.
- *Third party platforms*; I researched implementations of third party apps to increase workflows. Mostly between SCIA and Revit and using apps like Speckle.

In February of 2021 I started to assist a graduate student at our firm and help in her project. Her research is towards the previously described balconies and in finding a standardized shape that can be parametrized. In the research, she opts to create a family that can be edited in Dynamo to create the concrete slab and then adding premade elements (anchors, openings and gains) to it in Dynamo as well. In February of 2022 I started to assist another graduate student, as he researched 3D reinforcements. As he looked at all aspects, I helped him in the automization part of reinforcements.

## Alklima Warmtepompen
_Oct 2017 - Apr 2019_

During my bachelors I wanted to acquire experience at an office in the built environment. I found a job near my hometown where I assisted the sales department of a distributor of heat-pumps. My activities were to make cooling/heating calculations, design heat-pump systems and answer questions that many installers had. I worked at hotels, schools, single houses and offices. Also during my job, I helped in cleaning up customer databases and databases containing specifications of the heat-pumps. As these databases were based on Excel, I gained proficiency with Excel and macros which I used to automate the process.
