## Movares
_dec 2022 - now_

In December 2022 I joined the Grasshopper team of Movares as a Digital Engineer. Our team developed a method to automate the calculations on concrete bridges. This involved 

The team, which were mostly civil engineers, wanted their code to be more robust and scalable. That was my main role in the team. I refactored a lot of code; making code faster, scalable and readable. Also I started our own Grasshopper plugin; _Moose_. Moose contains several useful (for our team) plugins. I implemented a Report Generator that was created by colleagues in a Component, wrote components that performed permutations and components that handled data and math a lot quicker than Grasshopper. Also, using the full power of the Grasshopper API, I wrote components that interacted and reacted with loading the file, automatic reading in Rhino data and displaying them in checklists.

However after three months, due to the nitrogen crisis in the Netherlands, the activities of our team (and 3 other teams) was set on pause. After properly stopping our work, our team was divided over different projects. Now, I assist different teams with issues with complex Rhino Geometry and Revit data. Developing good workflows for exporting complex Rhino geometry to Revit, and writing scripts to optimize the geometry. Also, many teams were having issues with data, and I wrote several scripts to fill / remove / add data or to automatically open and edit families in a project.

## Pieters Bouwtechniek
_sep 2020 - nov 2022_

In September 2020 I joined Pieters Bouwtechniek as Engineer. I worked mostly on large housing projects as designer or coordinating. In these and many other projects, I learned the ins and outs of BIM designing and I learned a lot about structural engineering. Reinforcing concrete in entire projects, researching old archives, and structurally checking the architect's choices in the early stages of the design, were my daily activities. I always continued to be involved in projects, growing into a coordinating role.

From my beginning, I used Dynamo to optimize my own workflows. I feel that Dynamo has great potential because it combines computational power with the most used BIM software. During my first projects, I started to map out actions that I would repeatedly do and replace them with small Dynamo scripts. These were very simple scripts that would allow me to rotate multiple objects, automatically make hollow-core slabs, tag all the elements in a sheet, or automatically fix foundation poles.

After half a year I joined the Developer team, which is a small team of 2 colleagues in Amsterdam, to assist them in the software they write under the name of PBToolbox. Mostly we write add-ins (in C#) for our designers to use in Revit projects. Here I developed a deep knowledge of the RevitAPI, WinForms, and how to collaborate in a team (in Azure DevOps). As the team was very small, I reviewed and improved a lot of older code. Examples of software I wrote are:

- *Modelchecker*; In projects, a lot of time is spent verifying the data in a BIM-model. Therefore I wrote a program that verifies the data in a model and displays elements that do not conform to BIM- or Pieters-protocol. This included a UI that displays errors and warnings and lets users easily focus on elements.
- *Automatic reinforcements*; I wrote several functions that automatically make reinforcements in all selected beams. 
- *3DBAG*; I wrote an implementation of the 3D BAG database by the TU Delft so that our designers can import data from around their project.
- *Dimension tools*; I wrote several functions that place dimensions, which can be combined with the creation of views or drawings.
- *Exporting data*; In some projects, assemblies are used to create part lists; With our tools, we made it easy to export Revit Data to Excel.
- *Third-party platforms*; I researched implementations of third-party apps to increase workflows. Mostly between SCIA and Revit and using apps like Speckle.

In February of 2021, I started to assist a graduate student at our firm and help in her project. Her research is towards the previously described balconies and in finding a standardized shape that can be parametrized. In the research, she opts to create a family that can be edited in Dynamo to create the concrete slab and then add premade elements (anchors, openings, and gains) to it in Dynamo as well. In February of 2022, I started to assist another graduate student, as he researched 3D reinforcements. As he looked at all aspects, I helped him in the automation part of reinforcements.

## Alklima Warmtepompen
_Oct 2017 - Apr 2019_

During my bachelor's I wanted to acquire experience in an office in the built environment. I found a job near my hometown where I assisted the sales department of a distributor of heat pumps. My activities were to make cooling/heating calculations, design heat-pump systems, and answer questions that many installers had. I worked at hotels, schools, single houses, and offices. Also during my job, I helped in cleaning up customer databases and databases containing specifications of the heat pumps. As these databases were based on Excel, I gained proficiency with Excel and macros which I used to automate the process.
